//Yes, I can read the text from the paper you linked. A maximal independent set (MIS) filtration is a sequence of sets of vertices V0 ⊃ V1 ⊃ … ⊃ Vk ⊃ ∅ such that each set Vi is a maximal independent set of the graph G with respect to a certain distance factor 2^i. This means that for each set Vi, no two vertices in the set are connected by an edge and the graph distance between any pair of vertices in the set is greater than 2^i.

//Here is an example implementation of a function that constructs an MIS filtration for a given graph using TypeScript:

interface Graph {
  vertices: number[][];
  edges: number[][];
}

function createFiltration(graph: Graph): number[][] {
  const filtration: number[][] = [];
  
  let i = 0;
  let V = graph.vertices.map((_, index) => index);
  
  while (V.length > 0) {
    const Vi: number[] = [];
    const VStar = [...V];
    
    while (VStar.length > 0) {
      const v = VStar.shift()!;
      Vi.push(v);
      
      const neighbors = findNeighbors(v, i, graph);
      VStar = VStar.filter(vertex => !neighbors.includes(vertex));
    }
    
    filtration.push(Vi);
    V = difference(V, Vi);
    i++;
  }
  
  return filtration;
}

function findNeighbors(v: number, i: number, graph: Graph): number[] {
  // TODO: Implement this function
}

function difference(a: number[], b: number[]): number[] {
  // TODO: Implement this function
}

//This function takes a Graph object as input and returns an array of arrays representing the MIS filtration of the graph. The Graph object should have a vertices property that is an array of arrays representing the adjacency list of the graph and an edges property that is an array of arrays representing the edges of the graph.

//The function constructs the MIS filtration by iteratively constructing each set Vi using the procedure described in the paper. It starts with an auxiliary set V* that initially contains all vertices of the graph. Then it repeatedly chooses a random vertex v from V*, adds it to Vi, and removes from V* all vertices whose graph distance to v is less than or equal to 2^i. This process continues until V* is empty.

//I hope this helps you understand how to construct an MIS filtration for a given graph. You will need to fill in the details of the findNeighbors and difference functions according to your specific needs.
